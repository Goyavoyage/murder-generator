(** The type of relation generator.
 * It takes a character, which is usually a character whose current relation
 * complexity and difficulty is far from what the associated player expects.
 * It also takes a list of character to be used in priority in relations
 * (because their own complexity and difficulty are also far from from the
 * target complexity and difficulty).
 * It then returns a list a relations to be added, as well as some history
 * associated to this relation.
 * Note that these relations wonâ€™t necessary be applied: if the solver
 * considers these relations to be too complex in combination to the current
 * ones, or that the histories are incompatibles with the current history of
 * players, the solver might ask an other generator.
 * The flag indicates when this generator should be used again.
 * Generators may carry internal variables to be updated: the returned
 * generator is used for this. **)
