(** Module Relation
 * Explicits the different types of relations between characters. **)

type basic (** Basic relations **) =
  | Neutral (** The two characters doesnâ€™t know each other. **)
  | Hate (** The two characters hate each others, or have motive to specifically hinder the actions of the other one. **)
  | Trust (** The two characters have reasons to trust each others. **)
  | Chaotic (** The characters may hinder or help each other, but it will never be an end goal: their interactions will naturally just to these kinds of alliances and hindering. **)
  | Undetermined (** The characters knows things about each others, but are not sure whether they can trust the other or whether they should stop its actions. A typical example is old friends who ceased to contact each others long ago. **)
  | Avoidance (** Both characters try to avoid one each other, or to avoid saying a specific subject. For instance, if one hides something from the other. **)

type relation (** The type of relations between players **) =
  | Basic of basic (** A basic relation, as shown above. **)
  | Asymetrical of basic * basic (** There is some kind of asymmetry. For instance, one know things about the other (from a newspaper or from the point of view of other characters) but not the other: there would then probably be a relation Asymetrical (Neutral, Undetermined). **)
  | Explosive of relation * relation (** There is some kind of contradictions in the relation between the two characters. For instance, they love each others, but one is forced to do something against this player (which would probably be a relation Explosive (Basic Trust, Basic Chaotic)). These are really complex relations and the generator should avoid to create too many of them. **)

type t (** This type is a relation coupled with a boolean stating whether the relation is strong or not **) =
  relation
  * bool (** Whether the relation is strong or not. **)

val complexity : t -> int (** How complex it is to understand the character relation. **)
val difficulty : t -> int (** How complex it is to play and survive the murder. **)

val is_strong : t -> bool (** Whether a relation is strong. **)
val is_explosive : t -> bool (** Whether the relation is explosive. **)

(** The following two functions remove all the Asymetrical constructors, replacing them by either the left or right basic relation. **)
val left_projection : t -> t
val right_projection : t -> t

(** Compose two relations. Tries to summarize both into one. **)
val compose : t -> t -> t

(** Converts a relation to a string, for bebugging purposes. **)
val to_string : t -> string
