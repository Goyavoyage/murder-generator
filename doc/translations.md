TODO: explains how the file [translations.json](../web/translations.json) works.

The language code it is the usual [ISO 629](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes) code, two-letter if there is one, otherwise the three-letter one: “en” for English, “de” for German, etc.

Note that I haven’t thought much about how to handle languages that write right-to-left.
If you want to translate this program into such a language, please [contact me](https://github.com/Mbodin).
